# Arduino Serial Console Games

Inspired by old school text based console games, I made a couple of games for the Arduino.  
These games such as they are should work on the Arduino UNO. Or most
other Arduino boards, they use the serial console for output.  
These are incomplete, I started working on both a couple of years ago, got side tracked, and never got back to them, I was going to finish them, but the question is when.  
I decided to go ahead and put them on github, maybe someone else will finish them.  
find a million is based on "Deal or No Deal", what works, is randomizing the cases, making case choices, what isn't working, is the banker, and the final deal.  
What could be improved - Maybe list the cases avaiable after each choice, and maybe some banter about the amounts of money left in the cases, and the amount that was just lost.  
MonsterRPG is even less done, what works, is a random-ish NPCs, and displays the "monster" stats, and then displays "your player" stats.  
That about it, I never had a good idea about what to do with it beyond this, so have fun.  
And if you do finish these, give me a pull request, I'd love to see how someone finishes these.
